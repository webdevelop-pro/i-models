# i-models

`i-models` is the shared Go schema-contract module used by Torque services. It
defines PostgreSQL-backed model structs, table and content-type names, enum
values, JSON projections, and a small generic CRUD facade. It does not own
database migrations and it is not a standalone service.

The module path is `github.com/webdevelop-pro/i-models`. The repository is
currently built with Go 1.25 and the sibling services analyzed for this guide
use release `v0.0.2`.

## Where it sits

```text
PostgreSQL migrations
        │ define tables, columns and enum labels
        ▼
     i-models
        │ shared structs, constants and persistence helpers
        ├── evm-api: EVM projections, contract/offer constants, audit logs
        ├── wallet-api: wallets, transactions and funding sources
        ├── payment-api: investment and crypto-settlement projections
        ├── escrow-api: offer, investment-profile and user projections
        ├── kyc-api: profile/KYC mutation and audit records
        ├── esign-api: investment, offer, filer and notification contracts
        ├── email-worker: notification/email data and event qualification
        └── filer-api: Pub/Sub processing leases
```

Services are free to define narrower projections by embedding an `i-models`
type or by implementing the same `Fields`, `Table`, and `SetID` contract. Many
newer services query those projections with `go-common/orm`; older paths use
the compatibility helpers in [`models`](models/README.md).

## Basic use

```go
import (
    "github.com/webdevelop-pro/i-models/models"
    "github.com/webdevelop-pro/i-models/profiles"
)

profile, err := models.RetrieveOne[profiles.Profile](
    ctx,
    repo,
    map[string]any{"id": profileID},
)
```

Every type accepted by the generic helpers has a pointer form that implements:

```go
SetID(any)
Fields() []string
Table() string
```

Types with `SetDB` also receive the repository after `RetrieveOne`,
`RetrieveAll`, or `Create`. The supported operations are:

- `RetrieveOne` and `RetrieveAll` with equality filters expressed as
  `map[string]any`;
- `Create` with a column/value map;
- `Update`, `Exists`, and `Delete` with equality filters;
- deprecated `RetriveOne` and `RetriveAll` spellings for source compatibility.

For joins, ordering, row locks, compare-and-swap updates, or transaction-bound
work, use `go-common/orm/v2`, Squirrel, or repository SQL directly. The
`investments` and `pubsubactivities` packages expose dedicated helpers where a
shared concurrency protocol is part of the domain contract.

## Model conventions

- Database columns are identified by `db` tags. JSON/YAML tags describe API or
  event serialization and may intentionally hide fields.
- `Fields()` is the default SELECT projection. It is not guaranteed to contain
  every tagged field in the struct.
- `Table()` is the canonical table name used by the generic ORM.
- `ToJSON`/`ToMap` are explicit projections; inspect them before using their
  output at an external boundary.
- Enum types mirror PostgreSQL enum labels. Call `IsValid` where available at
  untrusted input boundaries; an enum's Go type alone does not validate a cast
  string.
- Nullable enums use generated-style wrappers such as `offers.NullOfferT`.
- [`pgtype.Timestamptz`](pgtype/README.md) is a compatibility wrapper for SQL,
  JSON, finite timestamps, and PostgreSQL infinity values.

“Direct consumer” means an import was found in the checked sibling Go module;
it does not imply ownership of the corresponding table. A service may still
access a table through a local projection or raw SQL.

## Transactions and concurrency

Pass a `pgx.Tx` (or another compatible `db.Repository`) to helpers when several
writes must commit atomically. Do not read with the pool and write with the
transaction in the same unit of work.

Investment funding/redemption transitions use explicit `FOR UPDATE` helpers in
[`investments`](investments/README.md). Pub/Sub consumers should use the fenced
lease API in [`pubsubactivities`](pubsubactivities/README.md); a boolean dedupe
check alone cannot prevent stale workers from overwriting newer outcomes.

## Important compatibility notes

- The `wallets` and `transactions` packages retain stateful `Save` APIs for
  legacy consumers. New code should prefer explicit `models.Update` or
  transaction-scoped ORM calls.
- `evmwallets`, `evmcontracts`, and the retired `evmtransfers` types also expose
  `Save`, but currently have no public setters that populate their internal
  update map. Treat those methods as compatibility-only.
- `wallets.SetOutBalanceFN` and `wallets.SetBalanceFN` currently mutate
  `IncBalance`; callers should not use them until that legacy behavior is fixed.
- The documentation describes the checked source, not an assumed generated ORM
  API. In particular, `i-models/models` accepts equality maps only.

## Validation

Run the normal suite from this repository:

```sh
./make.sh test
go vet ./...
```

The default suite checks enum contracts, projections, persistence behavior, and
the in-memory parts of Pub/Sub coordination. Live PostgreSQL schema comparison
is opt-in because it requires a database configured with the application
schema:

```sh
I_MODELS_SCHEMA_TEST=1 go test ./schemaconformance
```

When changing a table, column, or PostgreSQL enum, coordinate the migration,
the relevant model and its `Fields()` projection, schema-conformance registry,
and every consuming service in the same release plan.

## Non-runtime tooling

[`experiments`](experiments/Readme.md) is a separate Go module containing
SQLBoiler template experiments. It is not imported by the runtime packages and
is not part of `go test ./...` from the root module.
